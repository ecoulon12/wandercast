NOTES I OBSERVED WHILE WORKING
I2C: When finding which address to use, most i2c devices are 7 bit addresses, 
so we need to shift them to be 8bit (add in a 0 to the lsb)
- For example, the LCD address is listed as 0x3D (00111101),
  but i needed to pass it in as (0x3D << 1) or 0x7A (01111010) for it to WORKING


BME280 BAROMETER:
- IMPORTANT: when writing init function, reference p17 of the datasheet
  It gives good advice for settings for weather monitoring specifically
- bme280_init() explanation - basically, i needed to edit specific bits in each of the registers
  without changing other bits. This means, you can't just write to the register because you don't
  want to overwrite existing data. To get around this, i am reading the current register, changing the
  bits using a masking routine, then writing it back to the device.
  - That being said, i don't think this one is working yet? The main function is currently a test that 
    should increment and print every time the status bit goes high (sample is being taken). 


  Trying to see if i can push changes
